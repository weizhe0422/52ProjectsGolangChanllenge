 # Golang challenge: 52 projects
 A project to push me to write a small project in every interval time. This project will be written by Golang.
 
 ## Preface
  This project was inspired by @kkdai(https://github.com/kkdai). Therefor I create this project to push me to finish it.
  
 ## Constraint
  Here are the constraints of Project52. (Copy from https://github.com/kkdai/project52)
  - The project could be small or big, but it should be something new not just refactoring an old project.
  - The Programming language is not limited, feel free to write any language you have just learnt. (actually I am interested in writing some R packages, just because I want to learn it.)
  - Don't need to create brand new project, you could rewrite some exist project. (but on your own way, not allow to fork and refine.)
